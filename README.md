# Slide Presentation Tool using Mediapipe and OpenCV

This is a repository for a slide presentation tool created using Mediapipe and OpenCV. The tool enables the user to navigate through a presentation using hand gestures captured by a webcam.

## Installation
To use this tool, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- Mediapipe
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI

To install these libraries, you can run the following command:
> pip install mediapipe opencv-python pyautogui

## Usage
To use the tool, simply run the ´slide-gestures.py´ script using Python:
> python slide-gestures.py

Once the script is running, you can navigate through your presentation using the following hand gestures:
- Thumb up: Move to the next slide
- Little finger up: Move to the previous slide
- Hands close: Start symbol record

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the Mediapipe Hands solution from Google, and the PyAutoGUI library by Al Sweigart.
